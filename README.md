# AWS Assisted Pipline for A Recommondation System

### Yunrui Bao

## Problem Description: 
As we entered the digital era, sellers embraced online platforms, offering consumers the convenience of shopping from home. However, this transition also brought with it a surplus of information that often leaves consumers overwhelmed and confused. To address this issue of information overload, recommender systems have been developed. These systems enhance the user experience by providing accurate, personalized recommendations that align with individual preferences, thereby simplifying the decision-making process for users.
I am collaborating with a startup called “Encore,” which is pioneering the first entirely short video-based resale marketplace platform. The main selling format is an auction where the pre-recorded videos of the items feature human or AI narrators describing the products. The uniqueness of this startup lies in its focus on developing a new second-hand platform aimed at younger users, a demographic not fully captured by current companies.


## Social Science Implication: 
This project addresses the social science research problem of understanding consumer behavior in digital environments. By analyzing large datasets of user interactions and item information, the recommendation algorithm can reveal patterns and preferences that are not immediately apparent, providing insights into consumer decision-making processes. This aligns with computational social science by combining data science with behavioral analysis to better understand and predict user actions.

## Solution: 

## Next Step: 

social science research problem, justification of the importance of using scalable computing methods to solve it, as well as a description of the large-scale computing methods you employ in the project.

Project Idea: In the rapidly evolving e-commerce landscape, personalized recommendation systems are pivotal in enhancing user experience and driving sales. This project aims to develop a sophisticated recommendation algorithm for an e-commerce platform, focusing on matching users with items that align with their preferences and historical behavior. By leveraging large-scale computing methods, this project seeks to improve the accuracy and efficiency of item recommendations, ultimately increasing user satisfaction and retention.


Methodology: The project will utilize machine learning techniques, specifically collaborative filtering, to build the recommendation system. Collaborative filtering will be employed to predict user preferences based on interactions with similar users and items. The dataset will consist of extensive user data (e.g., past purchases, browsing history) and item data (e.g., category, price, reviews) from the e-commerce platform.
