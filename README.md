Project Idea: In the rapidly evolving e-commerce landscape, personalized recommendation systems are pivotal in enhancing user experience and driving sales. This project aims to develop a sophisticated recommendation algorithm for an e-commerce platform, focusing on matching users with items that align with their preferences and historical behavior. By leveraging large-scale computing methods, this project seeks to improve the accuracy and efficiency of item recommendations, ultimately increasing user satisfaction and retention.

Relevance to Social Science: This project addresses the social science research problem of understanding consumer behavior in digital environments. By analyzing large datasets of user interactions and item information, the recommendation algorithm can reveal patterns and preferences that are not immediately apparent, providing insights into consumer decision-making processes. This aligns with computational social science by combining data science with behavioral analysis to better understand and predict user actions.

Methodology: The project will utilize machine learning techniques, specifically collaborative filtering, to build the recommendation system. Collaborative filtering will be employed to predict user preferences based on interactions with similar users and items. The dataset will consist of extensive user data (e.g., past purchases, browsing history) and item data (e.g., category, price, reviews) from the e-commerce platform.
